- I worked on my own for this assignment

### What resources did you use?

_Please give specific URLs (not "Stack Overflow" or "Google") and state which
ones were particularly helpful. State whether you used AI and, if so, which

- I think the most difficult part of this assignment was taking a step back and just looking at the entire code base. This project requires a lot of understanding of the already written code to be completed, and taking a step back and understanding can be difficult at times. The most rewarding part of this assignment was seeing it all work together, this assignment along with the wordle one felt like actual projects rather than an assignment that is an abstraction of an actual project. Although I liked that this project was pretty fleshed out ( I also thought the small language model lab was pretty cool!), I know that some of my peers found this assignment to be a bit of a jump from the last one, I feel like a few more intermediary projects that require less of a step back and mass understanding of the pre-written code could be put in place before giving us this one would improve the pacing.
