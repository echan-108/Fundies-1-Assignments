# SUMMARY

Answer all the questions. Please put your answers _after_ the brackets with
the point count.

## Logistics

### Did you successfully implement everything that was requested?

_Answer "Yes", or state here which parts did not work or which tests did not
pass._ [1 point]

Yes

### How long did the assignment take?

_Rather than giving a range, if you are unsure, give the average of the range._
[1 point]

About 3 hours

### Who did you work with and how?

_Discussing the assignment with people not on your team is fine as long as you
don't share code. **Please explicitly state (yes or no)** whether you attended any
office hours, and mention any TAs who were especially helpful._ [1 point]

I worked on my own to complete this assignment

### What was your AI usage?

_State explicitly (yes or no) whether you used AI. If so, say which tools you
used and what your prompts were. Your assignment will not be graded if you do
not answer this question._ [1 point]

I did not use AI to complete this assignment

### What resources did you use?

_Please give specific URLs (not "Stack Overflow" or "Google") and state which
ones were particularly helpful_ [1 point]

I used class resources to complete this assignment

## Functional Programming

### What do you think of functional programming?

_What do you like or dislike about it? Had you used it before? Would you like to
use it again?_ [3 points]

I like functional programming, I think there are cases where functional programming can cut down on a lot of repeated
code which is very nice. However, I think often more times, the imperative solution to a problem is more readable and
easier to think through. I had used functional programming a little bit before, but never to the extent shown in this
lesson. I would like to use it again, only if it makes solving a problem more convienent.

### Debugging

_What was your debugging process like? For example, did you use the debugger or
print statements? Did the tests help you find bugs?_ [2 points]

My debugging process consisted of me running code, and using the tests that failed to give me information on how I had
failed to solve the problem. These tests did help me find bugs, or times where my implementation was not up to spec.

## Reflections

_Give **one or more paragraphs** reflecting on your experience with the
assignment, including answers to all of these questions:_

* What was the most difficult part of the assignment?
* What was the most rewarding part of the assignment?
* What did you learn doing the assignment?

_Constructive and actionable suggestions for improving assignments, office
hours, and lecture are always welcome._

The most difficult part of this assignment was the implementation of the wordle game. It took me a lot of different
tries, and a lot of different strategies before I found one that was successful. To solve this problem, I had to start
thinking semi imperativly and start off using the indicies. This was different than how I had to solve all the other
functional programming problems in the minecraft file, where I focused on the items in the list themselves. The most
rewarding part of this lesson, was seeing all the code that I had written before all condensed into one statement, It
was nice to see how far I had come. During this assginment I learned a lot about functional programming, and was able to
practices those skills.
