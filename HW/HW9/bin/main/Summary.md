## Logistics

### Did you successfully implement everything that was requested?

_Answer "Yes", or state here which parts did not work._ [1 point]

Yes

### How long did the assignment take?

_Rather than giving a range, if you are unsure, give the average of the range._
[1 point]

2 - 3 Hours

### Who did you work with and how?

_Discussing the assignment with people not on your team is fine as long as you
don't share code. Please state whether you attended any office hours._ [1 point]

I worked on my own for this assignment

### What was your AI usage?

_State explicitly (yes or no) whether you used AI. If so, say which tools you
used and what your prompts were. Your assignment will not be graded if you do
not answer this question._ [1 point]

I did not use AI to complete the assignment

### What resources did you use?

_Please give specific URLs (not "Stack Overflow" or "Google") and state which
ones were particularly helpful._ [2 points]

I used class resources to complete this assignment

## Reflections

_Give **one or more paragraphs** reflecting on your experience with the
assignment, including answers to all of these questions:_

- What was the most difficult part of the assignment?
- What was the most rewarding part of the assignment?
- What did you learn doing the assignment?

_Constructive and actionable suggestions for improving assignments, office
hours, and lecture are always welcome._

The most difficult part of this assignment was the refactoring, When you refactor code, you have to keep so many things in mind so that you don't mess your entire code base up before you finish. The most rewarding part of this assignment was creating a zombie spawner spawner, It tied everything together really nicely and was a fun idea. During this assignment I brushed up on the how to refactor code and kotlin inheritance semantics
