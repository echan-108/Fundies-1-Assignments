# SUMMARY

Answer all the questions. Please put your answers _after_ the brackets with
the point count.

## Logistics

### Did you successfully implement everything that was requested?
_Answer "Yes", or state here which parts did not work or which tests did not
pass._ [1 point]

### How long did the assignment take?

_Rather than giving a range, if you are unsure, give the average of the range._
[1 point]

### Who did you work with and how?

_Discussing the assignment with people not on your team is fine as long as you
don't share code. **Please explicitly state (yes or no)** whether you attended any
office hours, and mention any TAs who were especially helpful._ [1 point]

### What was your AI usage?

_State explicitly (yes or no) whether you used AI. If so, say which tools you
used and what your prompts were. Your assignment will not be graded if you do
not answer this question._ [1 point]

### What resources did you use?

ones were particularly helpful_ [1 point]

## Functional Programming

### What do you think of functional programming?

_What do you like or dislike about it? Had you used it before? Would you like to
use it again?_ [3 points]

### Debugging

_What was your debugging process like? For example, did you use the debugger or
print statements? Did the tests help you find bugs?_ [2 points]


## Reflections

_Give **one or more paragraphs** reflecting on your experience with the
assignment, including answers to all of these questions:_

* What was the most difficult part of the assignment?
* What was the most rewarding part of the assignment?
* What did you learn doing the assignment?

_Constructive and actionable suggestions for improving assignments, office
hours, and lecture are always welcome._
