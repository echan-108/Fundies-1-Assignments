## Testing and debugging

_Describe your testing and debugging experience, including the following._

- What did you think of writing tests?
- Did you think of edge cases when writing tests that caused you to go back
  and change your implementation?
- Did your tests uncover bugs?
- Were there bugs (mistakes) in your tests?
- What was your debugging process like?
- How confident are you in the correctness of your code?

_Although I understand their importance, I thought that writing tests was a little tedious. I didn't really think of any edge cases, although the prompt to replay did make me change my implementation of the playgame function. My tests didn't uncover any bugs, but that is because I wrote a wordle like program in highschool and was fairly familiar with how to take on this project. There were a few bugs in the AI generated tests that I had to correct, but I think I was able to weed them all out. I am fairly confident in the correctness of this code._ [5 points]

## Reflections

_Give **one or more paragraphs** reflecting on your experience with the
assignment, including answers to all of these questions:_

- What was the most difficult part of the assignment?
- What was the most rewarding part of the assignment?
- What did you learn doing the assignment?

\_The most difficult part of this assignment was writing the tests. I couldn't really think of any edge cases, and they get kind of tediuos to write after a point. The most rewarding part of this assignment was finishing it, and seeing what I accomplished. In this assignment I brushed up more on kotlin loop syntax, string methods, and stringbuilders\_\_
