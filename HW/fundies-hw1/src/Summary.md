_This assignment went well for me. The Lab worked helped me learn the kotlin syntax that I needed to complete this
assignment. The most difficult part of this assignment was casting from the readln() String to an Int. It took me a
while to understand the syntax for casting, and I am still unsure as to whether_ `!!.toInt()` or
` val xInt: Int? x as? Int` is better practice. The most rewarding part however, was getting casting to work, overcoming
the hardest part of a problem is always the most rewarding for me. During this assignment, I learned about casting in
kotlin. I also learned kotlin syntax for things I knew how to do in previous languages such as printing to the console,
reading lines, and declaring and assigning value to variables_
