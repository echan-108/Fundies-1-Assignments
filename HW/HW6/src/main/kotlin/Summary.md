instructions and bracketed point counts.

## Logistics

### Did you successfully implement everything that was requested?

_Answer "Yes", or state here which parts did not work or which tests did not
pass._ [1 point]

[1 point]
This assignment took around 6 hours

### Who did you work with and how?

_Discussing the assignment with people not on your team is fine as long as you
don't share code. Please state whether you attended any office hours._ [1 points]
I worked on my own for this assignment

### What resources did you use?

_Please give specific URLs (not "Stack Overflow" or "Google") and state which
ones were particularly helpful. State whether you used AI and, if so, which
tools you used and how you used them._ [2 points]
I used class resources to complete this assignment

## Minecraft

_Give **one or more paragraphs** answering these questions:_

- Have you ever played Minecraft? If so, do you prefer creative or survival
  mode?
- What types of computer games, if any, do you enjoy?
- What addition(s) did you make to the game?
- What were some bugs that you made and fixed?
- For this assignment, you had to work with existing code and documentation.
  Do you enjoy doing that or do you prefer writing everything yourself?
- How do you feel about your progress and understanding?

_There are no wrong (honest) answers._ [5 points]
I have played minecraft. I prefer survival mode. I enjoy narrative driven video games like 1000xResist the most. A bug that I had was that when I was referencing the position of an object in my calculate distance problem, I kept getting an illegal argument exception. This was because my condition for throwing this exception was bad, but it took me a really long time to realize this because I thought that my arguemnts were faulty and not the function itself. I prefer writing everything myself because it is easier to keep everything that is within the scope of the project in mind. I feel that I am progressign through this class to a satisfactory degree.

## Reflections

_Give **one or more paragraphs** reflecting on your experience with the
assignment, including answers to all of these questions:_

_Constructive and actionable suggestions for improving assignments, office
hours, and lecture are always welcome._

The most difficult part of this assignment was a tossup between it's scope, and it's null semantics. With a codebase this large, we really had to look over the documentation in detail, and then keep all of that information in mind while coding in order to compelte this assignment efficiently. Additionally, I still don't have kotlin null semantics committed to memory to the extent that I would like. the most rewarding part of this assignment was seeing it all run and work. I liked seeing everything I put together work without any major flaws. The fact that there was a visualization was nice. During this assignment, I brushed up on kotlin semantics, and learned roe abour working in a large codebase.

For the feedback, it is frustrating that steve always dies to the zombie because the zombie gets to attack first. I would have changed steve's attack, but I didn't know if that was allowed, specifically allowing this would make the program more satisfying.
