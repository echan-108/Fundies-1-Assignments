The most Difficult Part of this assignment was getting all of the conditions correct for the Artificial player. It took a lot of print statements to finally get a good combination of conditions. The most rewarding part of the assignment, was seeing the my algorithm crush wordle, getting the word in four tries fairly consistently. During this assignment, I brushed up on functional programming and inline funciton semantics
